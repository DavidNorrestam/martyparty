This purpose of this project is to provide a quiz game that can be used to learn to recognize plants and recite their swedish and latin names.

# Rules of the game
Five random plants are selected from the collection of plants (stored in the repository). The user then needs to answer five questions (depending on game mode - see below). After answering all questions, the user gets presented with their score, and for each incorrectly answered question - a recap of their answer, and the correct answer.

## Image → Swedish name
