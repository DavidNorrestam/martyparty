# AI-Driven Development in Martyparty

Martyparty is designed to support and encourage AI-assisted workflows for faster, higher-quality development.

## Recommended AI Tools
- [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot)
- OpenAI GPT models (e.g., ChatGPT)
- Other LLM-based code assistants

## Best Practices
- Use AI for code suggestions, refactoring, and documentation, but always review and test the output.
- Prefer clear, modular code and descriptive comments to help both humans and AI understand the project.
- When using AI to generate code or docs, check for:
  - Security issues
  - Accessibility
  - Performance
  - Consistency with project style
- Document any significant AI-generated changes in your PR description.

## Example Prompts
- "Write a Svelte component for a quiz question with accessibility in mind."
- "Suggest tests for the quiz store logic."
- "Refactor this function for clarity and performance."

## Cautions
- Do not blindly accept AI-generated codeâ€”review for correctness and security.
- Be aware of licensing and attribution for any code snippets.
